# OneLabeler-doc

OneLabeler's documentation website <https://microsoft.github.io/OneLabeler-doc>.

This website is written using [vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/).

## Build the Website

Before starting, make sure you have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

Install the dependencies and prepare the build environment:

```bash
npm install
```

Launch the development server:

```bash
npm run docs:dev
```

Build the website:

```bash
npm run docs:build
```

This will generate the website in the `./docs/.vuepress/dist` folder.
